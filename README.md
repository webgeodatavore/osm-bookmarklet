# OSM bookmarklet

This project is an attempt to help people discover various web services offered by OpenStreetMap and it ecosystem.

It helps syncing center and zoom for each URL. It's not restricted to go from commercial maps to OpenStreetMap (OSM) but also between various web maps available within OSM ecosystem.

At the moment, it only work on Google Maps website.

The idea comes from the website http://map.orhyginal.fr (we also borrowed a large part of the code, previously available on Github)
A more simple bookmarklet https://twitter.com/osmbuildings/status/501810389274066944 is available too.
